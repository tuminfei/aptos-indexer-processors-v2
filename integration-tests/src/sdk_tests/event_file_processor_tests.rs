//! Crash-recovery integration tests for the event file writer.
//!
//! These tests use the `failpoints` crate to inject failures at key locations inside
//! the writer's flush path, simulating crashes at different stages. Recovery is then
//! run against the same `LocalFileStore` to verify data integrity.
//!
//! Run with:
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo test -p integration-tests --features failpoints -- event_file
//! ```
//!
//! Failpoints are global singletons, so every test acquires the `FailScenario` lock to
//! avoid interference.
//!
//! Tests that don't require failpoints are in
//! `processor/src/processors/event_file/tests.rs`.
